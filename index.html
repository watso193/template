<a name="trevors-story" class="anchor" href="#trevors-story"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Trevors Story</h1>
            <p>Trevor’s narrative was more than just a written story.<br>
            He was able to pull together different sources of his memory together to form a video.<br>
            He wanted to share with people how a person that he looked up to tat suffered from 
            the same things as him went about dealing with his problems.<br>
            Trevor made it clear that what his uncle did was wrong in his eyes and that 
            that sets an example for what people that suffer form the same problems should do.<br>
            Trevor’s video was intriguing because of the way he presented things.  He 
            used things that he had written when he was younger, and put images of 
            writing in the video to create a more personal effect on the person watching
            the video.  It tries to put people in his shoes so that they feel like they
            are actually reading his original writings.  When Trevor presented his
            message he seemed like he was trying to catch the attention of the viewer
            and once he knew he had the attention then he would explain the issue.
            The biggest thing I took form this video to help change my own Lived
            Experience is how personal it was.  Trevor was explaining exactly how
            he felt with everything that had to do with him being gay and his uncle.</p>

<a name="social-network-analysis------------" class="anchor" href="#social-network-analysis------------"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Social Network analysis
            </h1><p>Technology has completely changed the way the writing and communication 
            happen.  The more advanced technology becomes the easier it is for people to
            communicate to one another.  People no longer have to talk to people face to
            face.  They can call, text, email and come in contact with each other in
            numerous other ways as well.  I personally think people have became more 
            cowardly and are not confrontational because it is so easy to say what you 
            want without people being in front of you.  Twitter, Facebook, blogs, and 
            the Internet allow people to say whatever they want with out having to 
            worry what would happen to them if they said it out loud.  People don’t
            use proper English on any of the social networks either because it sounds 
            “cool.”  When I first started chatting with my friends on AOL I would use 
            any slang possible.  It felt like I was speaking a different language that only 
            people my age could understand.  I would catch myself using the same type
            of language in school and in writing papers.  People no longer use the
            correct way of writing unless they absolutely have to.  It feels weird 
            to read something that actually makes sense..</p>

<a name="hybrid-class" class="anchor" href="#hybrid-class"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hybrid class</h1>
            <p>Taking a hybrid class is probably one of the worst ideas in college.  On 
            the outside they sound pretty good; most things are online and class only meets
            one time a week.  The problem is when your ability to navigate a computer is
            as bad as mine finding out what needs to be done becomes a challenge of itself.
            I never know what I am supposed to be doing, what assignments are actually 
            assigned, and when assignments are due.  I have always been more of a tell me
            what I need to do rather than "go to this website and read this to find your 
            assignment."  Hopefully I never have to take another hybrid class again.  But
            if I do at least I will know what to expect.</p>

<a name="reading-assignments------------" class="anchor" href="#reading-assignments------------"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reading Assignments
            </h1><p>One of the worst things in the world is reading assignments.  Being forced
            to read something that is not interesting or boring is almost imposible to complete 
            at times.  But when the assignment is about writing techniques...the reading
            becomes even more difficult.  If i was asked to create a list of ten things
            that I learned while reading in Science and Technology I would not be able
            to do it.  When something is as boring as reading about writing I can't absorb
            information about the material.</p>

<a name="chrysler" class="anchor" href="#chrysler"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CHRYSLER</h1>
            <p>The Chrysler commercial that takes place in Detroit takes on a different 
            approach than most commercials.  Rather than making the commercial flashy with bright lights and colors Chrysler went for a more meaningful message.  The commercial has an older man speaking that sounds like he has not had the easiest life based on his raspy voice.  The clips of Detroit are gloomy which show the heartache and suffering that the city has experienced.  As the clips keep rolling the voice explains some of the things that have happened to Detroit along with some of the things that people from around the country portray of the city.  People act as if nothing good can come from Detroit.  The tagline “Imported from Detroit” means that Detroit is looked at as a foreign place, place that people do not want to be a part of nor believe in.  Chrysler uses the word “imported” because it shows that Chrysler is not only something of Detroit.  It is an American company.  Detroit sets an example of what the rest of the country is capable of.</p><br><h1>
<a name="codecademy" class="anchor" href="#codecademy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Codecademy</h1>
            <p>Codecademy has been one of the most complicated assignments I have ever had to complete.  I am terrible when it comes to operating computers.  I can barely use Microsoft Word let alone create structures for websites and webpages.  Before Codecademy I had no idea what HTML or CSS meant.  I had no idea what coding even meant.  To be completely honest I am glad that I had to learn it.  I think it is interesting to see how websites are created.  HTML is almost like a completely different language.  There a countless codes that need to be memorized to become fluent with HTML.  I use the word fluent because it reminds me of learning a language.  When you learn a language you learn the basics.  New material is the introduced and you practice that until it becomes easy.  Once spate material is learned the materials can be brought together and reviewed.  Codecademy taught HTML and CSS in a similar way.  I don’t know exactly if I will ever have to use HTML, I most likely will, but learning the basics now will help me in the future.</p>

<a name="blogs" class="anchor" href="#blogs"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Blogs...</h1>
            <p>I really do not like writing blogs.  I have no idea what to write about 
            half the time and when I do I like I fill it in with pointless sentences
            and in the end the blog is not even long enough.  If I had a topic to write
            about the blogs would be much easier.  I also do not like how the blogs have to
            be related to the class.  I am usually only in class for an hour at the most
            and while I am sitting in class I have no idea what I am supposed to be doing.
            When I write blogs I sit an stare at a blank screen longer than I actually write
            the blog.  I also do not understand what the point of the blogs are.  I picture
            blogs as something that people write in whatever form they want.  It might make
            it easier for me to write a blog if I read one.  Hopefully I don't get marked down
            because my blogs are negative about the class.</p><p>

<a name="analysis-of-retrospective" class="anchor" href="#analysis-of-retrospective"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Analysis of Retrospective</h1>
            <p>I have no idea what needs to be done for the retrospective paper.  I have no
            idea what the point of making a rough draft was because I have no idea what I will
            eventually be doing with it.  My most concerning issue with this course is how vague 
            directions are.  I am part of a group but i have no idea what this group
            of people are supposed to do.  I know were supposed to find stuff to put on the
            website but I have no idea what kind of stuff.  I have never had to make a website
            before and not knowing how to do it is going to make it that much more challenging.
            As of right now I don't think anyone has any idea what is supposed to be going on with 
            the project.</p>

<a name="no-final------------" class="anchor" href="#no-final------------"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>NO FINAL
            </h1><p>I have never been so happy to not have a final in my life.  If there was a final
            in this class I would have no idea what it could even be on.  Not only am I glad that I don't
            have a final in this class but finals should only be required to take for pre-requisite 
            classes.  There is not point in taking a final in a class covering everything you have learned 
            if the material learned is not going to be needed.  In addition to that if someone
            has a 4.0 in a class they should not have to take a final either.  Basically to
            sum everything up I am ecstatic that there is not a final in this course.</p>

<a name="memo-of-group-project" class="anchor" href="#memo-of-group-project"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Memo of Group Project</h1>
            <p>The issue of social networking was a somewhat easy topic to compose because everyone in the group uses social networks.  During the composing process, I was able to realize how much of an issue social networks have become.  The hardest part of organizing the documentary was getting the video clips together.  When the documentary was finished we wanted the audience to be able to understand what was being presented and connect with the information given.</p>

<pre><code>        When we were looking through every ones papers we were trying to find a topic that we could all relate to and create a video documentary about without too much of a challenge, since none of us have made a documentary.  I found the piecing together of different video clips to create something that made sense to the audience was the most difficult.  It is because I am not familiar with editing.  

        The most beneficial type of research was when we would actually talk to people who use social networks.  In some way those are the people that this documentary is about.  It was also easy to find people that used social networks because a majority of people uses some kind of social network.  When I originally wrote the paper on social networks I found research on the Internet was difficult.  Most of the articles found presented statistics based on the type of people that use social networks.

        Each member of the group put their own ideas into the project.  A different member of the group filmed each clip to show a variety of people that use social networks.  The group project was beneficial because if someone did no understand something that needed to be done another group member could easily explain.

        We did not do a very great job when it came to planning out time to work on the project.  There was not very much class time, which was used to complete the documentary.  If I had to repeat this project I would have taken more time to meet up with the other group members.

        The most effective part of the documentary is the interviews with people that use social networks.  It allows the viewers to connect with the person being interviewed and ask themselves the same questions.  We wanted people watching to realize that social networks have become a problem.  Using other people that are similar to the viewers allowed
        us to dot that.
        &lt;h1&gt;Final Content&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Well no one has any idea as to what we are supposed to do for the Lived Experiences content
        for the final project.  The rubric for the project does not explain anything.  
        The group finally talked for about ten minutes an decided we would each write a paragraph about 
        what we experienced and how we felt about the Lived project.  I noticed that
        I was not the only who felt totally lost in this class the entire semester.  I wrote a 
        blog earlier about the retrospective paper that needs to be done for this project as well.
        I still have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing for that and probably never will.  I also 
        has to be the one to step up and say I would take care of sending in the content.  I guess people
        don't really care that I have asked numerous times for them to send it to me so I can get it done with 
        and send it to the people building the website.&lt;/p&gt;
